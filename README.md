## Installation

You can install Faker as a wally dependency by adding this to your `wally.toml` file:

```toml
Faker = "synpixel/faker@0.2.1"
```

## Why?

While at first sight this library might seem useless, it has various use cases, such as mocking Player instances for your interface.
Mocking user data can get very tiring if done manually, this library is here to help with that.
