I absolutely love making games, it’s the thing I am most passionate about. For me, there is no greater feeling than releasing a game and seeing people experience it for the first time. After finishing school, I took a risk and spent the summer making a game called “Break In (Story)” from my bedroom. I never expected it to do as well as it did and it’s still surreal to me how large it has become.\n\nAt the moment I make whatever inspires me. Sometimes that means I don’t get much time to work on old projects. If you’re a fan of one of my older games and it doesn’t get updated much: I’m sorry. I try to keep all my games playable but I’m just one person. I need to focus on doing what makes me happy, which is usually working on something new and exciting","displayName":"Cracky4"},{"created":"2015-08-28T00:47:33.013Z","name":"evaera","id":92658764,"description":"Hi, I'm Eryn! \n\nI've been on Roblox since 2008.
